      With the  development of society, jobs need us to regard the community service as part of school curriculum. Some people believe that we should not involve the community service in school curriculum. while others hold a completely different opinion.  I  agree with the former one, because of the assistance to capture a better work opportunity and the chance to cultivate outstanding characters.
       A period of favorable practice is upon us.  when we step into society, we face difficulties from directions, and it is  hard to attain a job position. Occasionally, we compete an occupation with thousands of opponents. So in this situation, the community service’s experiences will helps us to be diffrenciated from other opponents, being consider as a man who can competence this post perfectly and enhance our chance to acquire this job. In short, undergoing community services will contribute to grasp an enjoyable job.
        By  practicing, we will manage to foster characters. if a person without possess  community service’s experiences that he might not master the principle of helping others. After we get in touch with community services, we will harvest the entertainment from it and own a loving heart. For instance, we can assist the cleaner to sweep the streets or cook a dinner for the old man, who live alone. To be brief, we are able to reap a worm and willing heart.
  
      To sum up, although not get involved in the community service  save our time, it can help us to enlarge our opportunity to work in a designed job position,and train us with superior characters. Now, it’s the appropriate time for us to devote ourselves to the community services.
